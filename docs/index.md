DeepImageJ is a user-friendly environment that enables the use of a variety of pre-trained deep learning models in ImageJ. It bridges the gap between deep learning and standard life-science applications. DeepImageJ provides different plugins to guide ImageJ users while using trained deep learning models for their image analysis. Through DeepImageJ it is possible to perform a variety of common image processing tasks such as image classification, binary / semantic / instance / panoptic segmentation, denoising, deconvolution, virtual staining, regression, or super-resolution.
