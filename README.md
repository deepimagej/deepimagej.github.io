### The ImageJ plugin to run deep-learning models


DeepImageJ is a user-friendly plugin that enables the use of a variety of pre-trained deep learning models in ImageJ. 
The plugin bridges the gap between deep learning and standard life-science applications. 
DeepImageJ runs image-to-image operations on a standard CPU-based computer or on GPU, and does not require any deep learning expertise.
